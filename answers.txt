Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines two branches by creating a new commit that integrates the changes from both, preserving the history of each branch. Rebasing, on the other hand, rewrites the commit history by moving or "replaying" commits from one branch onto another, resulting in a cleaner, linear history without merge commits.
